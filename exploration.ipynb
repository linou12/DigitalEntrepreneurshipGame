While this showcases the product to potential customers, it does not generate immediate revenue and requires upfront costs for inventory and logistics.\n",
    "- **Feedback**: This idea is suboptimal because rental services tend to attract customers who prioritize low cost and convenience over quality and sustainability. The high rental price may deter potential customers, and the team risks spending resources without seeing a return.\n",

    "**Not Optimal Idea**: Cost Leadership and Sales through Retailers\n",

    "- **Feedback**: This strategy is not optimal because it undermines the premium quality and sustainability of the product.
