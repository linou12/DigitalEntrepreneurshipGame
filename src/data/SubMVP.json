    "Idea 1": {
        "Suboptimal MVP": "Promoting through Environmental Events",
        "Description": "Displaying the BambooBike in various environmental friendly events and fairs and spreading word about it through flyers.",
        "Feedback": "While connecting directly with a potentially eco-conscious audience is a good idea, the reach is significantly limited compared to methods like online marketing or pre-orders. The effort verses impact ratio might not be as high and hard to measure."
    },
    "Idea 2": {
        "Suboptimal MVP": "'Crowdfunding Campaign'",
        "Description": "Launching a crowdfunding campaign on platforms like Kickstarter or Indiegogo to drum up support and gather funds for the bamboo bicycle project.",
        "Feedback": "Kickstarter allows for great exposure and feedback, but is also risky because it publicly puts the product and brand reputation on the line before there's a proven customer base and before the product potentially being finalized."
    },
    "Idea 3": {
        "Suboptimal MVP": "Renting out Bamboo Bicycles",
        "Description": "Rent out the prototype bicycles in popular parks and recreational areas to gain visibility and feedback.",
        "Feedback": "While it may provide widespread exposure, being a rental object might not align well with the perceived value of the product. Keeping track of rentals and ensuring the bicycles' return could also add an unnecessary layer of complexity to the business at this early stage."
    },
    "Idea 4": {
        "Suboptimal MVP": "Pop-up Shops",
        "Description": "Setting up pop-up shops in busy urban areas to sell bamboo bicycles directly.",
        "Feedback": "Pop-up shops usually thrive on impulse buying, which may not align well with the price point and niche market of a bamboo bike. Location costs and permits can be expensive, and there's a risk of remaining unsold inventory."
    },
    "Idea 5": {
        "Suboptimal MVP": "Local Partnerships",
        "Description": "Partnering with local businesses and displaying bamboo bicycles on their premises or organizing joint promotional activities.",
        "Feedback": "Although this method can offer localized exposure, it may lack scalability and reach. Also, the partner's business needs to align well with your brand's image and values."
    },
    "Idea 6": {
        "Suboptimal MVP": "Collaboration with Influencers",
        "Description": "Engaging sustainable lifestyle influencers on social media platforms to promote bamboo bicycle products.",
        "Feedback": "Influencer partnerships can work but your brand is putting a lot of faith in another party to represent it accurately and favourably. This can escalate if the influencer exercises poor judgment."
    },
    "Idea 7": {
        "Suboptimal MVP": "Free Trial Offers",
        "Description": "Providing potential customers with an option to try out the bamboo bicycle free of charge for a limited duration.",
        "Feedback": "While it might generate interest, it could potentially attract only those customers who are enticed by free offers and not necessarily those willing to purchase the product."
    },
    "Idea 8": {
        "Suboptimal MVP": "Exhibiting in Bicycle Retail Stores",
        "Description": "Displaying the product in existing bicycle retail stores to leverage their customer base.",
        "Feedback": "While it may provide visibility, it can't guarantee qualified customers. It might also misalign the brand as a regular bicycle brand instead of a sustainable and unique offering."
    },
    "Idea 9": {
        "Suboptimal MVP": "Pitching to Bicycle Clubs & Groups",
        "Description": "Pitching the bamboo bicycle directly to cycling clubs and groups, both online and offline.",
        "Feedback": "It's a small segment of the available market and might neglect large numbers of individuals who aren't part of formal clubs or groups but could potentially be interested."
    },
    "Idea 10": {
        "Suboptimal MVP": "Door-to-Door Sales Approach",
        "Description": "Introducing the bamboo bicycle to potential customers by directly visiting them with a prototype and trying to secure orders.",
        "Feedback": "This is high effort with uncertain results. This might be seen as intrusive and doesn't necessarily reach the core market demographic."
