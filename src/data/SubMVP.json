{
    "Idea 1": {
        "Suboptimal MVP": "Launching a crowdfunding campaign without a prototype.",
        "Reason": "This approach reduces up-front costs and potentially generates initial seed funding. It can act as a test run to estimate interest in the product without needing to present a physical product.",
        "Feedback": "In theory, this approach seems cost-effective. A crowdfunding campaign, however, hinges on demonstrating a product\u2019s potential and capturing potential backers' imaginations, a task more readily accomplished with a tangible prototype.\"\n},\n  \"Idea 2\": {\n    \"Suboptimal MVP\": \"Partnering with bamboo suppliers in China to provide a 'design-your-own' bike service.\",\n    \"Reason\": \"This option allows for customization and a direct connection with the suppliers. It also tests market interest in custom bikes.\",\n    \"Feedback\": \"While customization is attractive, it introduces significant complexity and possible delays. The best initial approach is often a simplified, standardized product to test basic demand."
    },
    "Idea 2": {
        "Suboptimal MVP": "Massive production rush, making & selling as many bicycles as possible.",
        "Reason": "This strategy tests the market's appetite for the product at full scale.",
        "Feedback": "Producing at full scale before verifying market demand risks excessive product waste and severe financial loss if it is unsold."
    },
    "Idea 3": {
        "Suboptimal MVP": "Pitching and selling the product at local farm markets.",
        "Reason": "Potential for immediate feedback and sales while promoting sustainability.",
        "Feedback": "Local market environments may target a niche audience which may not represent the true market potential."
    },
    "Idea 4": {
        "Suboptimal MVP": "Setting up a physical store in a high-traffic area before launching online.",
        "Reason": "Seeing and testing the product in store could stimulate impulse purchasing.",
        "Feedback": "High setup costs coupled with the limited reach of a physical store makes this a risky option without prior online demand validation."
    },
    "Idea 5": {
        "Suboptimal MVP": "Utilize influencer marketing to promote pre-orders on a social media platform.",
        "Reason": "Influencers with significant followers in the sustainable living space can boost visibility.",
        "Feedback": "The high cost of influencer marketing requires knowing that the product-market fit exists. Feedback from influencer's followers may be skewed by the 'celebrity effect'."
    },
    "Idea 6": {
        "Suboptimal MVP": "Offering a subscription model with regular maintenance included.",
        "Reason": "This unique business model could attract customers desiring hassle-free ownership.",
        "Feedback": "The subscription model's complexity and possible customer hesitation due to being locked into a multi-year deal make this suboptimal."
    },
    "Idea 7": {
        "Suboptimal MVP": "Building an expensive and wide-ranging e-commerce platform.",
        "Reason": "It provides a variety of purchasing options to customers and showcases all previous and ongoing projects.",
        "Feedback": "Developing an expensive and extensive e-commerce platform prior to proof of concept and product-market validation could result in wasted resources."
    },
    "Idea 8": {
        "Suboptimal MVP": "Hiring an expensive PR firm to launch a huge marketing campaign.",
        "Reason": "High-visibility marketing could create a lot of buzz and interest.",
        "Feedback": "Without proof of product-market fit, this big-budget approach could quickly deplete resources with little ROI."
    },
    "Idea 9": {
        "Suboptimal MVP": "Offering bike leasing options instead of sales.",
        "Reason": "Leasing can widen the customer base by reducing the initial purchase barrier.",
        "Feedback": "Bike leasing is more complex and risk-prone due to issues like damage or theft. It might detract from the core product offering."
