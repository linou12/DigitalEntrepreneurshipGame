    "Idea 1": {
        "Not Optimal MVP": "Building prototypes without testing market interest.",
        "Description": "The team immediately sources bamboo and manufactures a small batch of bamboo bicycle prototypes before gauging market interest.",
        "Feedback": "This approach could lead to a major loss if there isn't enough demand for bamboo bikes. A better approach might be to validate demand before spending resources on building prototypes."
    },
    "Idea 2": {
        "Not Optimal MVP": "Crowdfunding Campaign without Prior Interest",
        "Description": "The team sets up a crowdfunding campaign to raise funds and brings the bike to market without a prior survey or advertising.",
        "Feedback": "Although crowdfunding can be effective, it requires a strong following or an existing audience. Attempting this without a pre-existing interest check might result in an unsuccessful campaign."
    },
    "Idea 3": {
        "Not Optimal MVP": "Print Advertising",
        "Description": "The team invests in print advertisements in newspaper and magazines to generate interest in the product.",
        "Feedback": "Print advertising can be expensive and it might not reach the targeted, eco-conscious audience. Digital marketing might be more appropriate and cost-effective."
    },
    "Idea 4": {
        "Not Optimal MVP": "Expensive Professional Product Photography",
        "Description": "The team decides to invest heavily in professional product photography to showcase the bicycle.",
        "Feedback": "While good product photography is important, investing heavily at the MVP stage is not recommended. The funds can be better spent elsewhere."
    },
    "Idea 5": {
        "Not Optimal MVP": "Setting up a Physical Store",
        "Description": "The team rents and sets up a physical store to display and sell the bamboo bicycles.",
        "Feedback": "The cost of setting up a retail store is high and it might not be effective in driving sales. A more optimal approach could be to sell online and invest time in marketing the product."
    },
    "Idea 6": {
        "Not Optimal MVP": "Participation in Trade Shows",
        "Description": "The team plans to present their bicyles in national and international trade shows.",
        "Feedback": "Participating in trade shows requires significant resources and there is no guarantee of potential sales or interest. A more affordable marketing strategy should be considered."
    },
    "Idea 7": {
        "Not Optimal MVP": "Banner Advertising on different websites",
        "Description": "The team wants to advertise on eco-sustainability websites using banners.",
        "Feedback": "Banner adverts can be seen as intrusive by users and are often overlooked. Focus on content marketing or more strategic PPC campaigns could be more beneficial."
    },
    "Idea 8": {
        "Not Optimal MVP": "Street Stalls",
        "Description": "Setting up stalls in various localities to display the bamboo bicycles and see the response from the public.",
        "Feedback": "This approach is time-consuming and may not be cost-effective. Instead, creating a buzz around the product online would be more efficient."
    },
    "Idea 9": {
        "Not Optimal MVP": "Television Advertising",
        "Description": "Creating a commercial to showcase the product and its sustainability on national television channels.",
        "Feedback": "TV advertising can be costly and is usually not necessary or cost-effective for startups. A more optimal use of funds could be targeted social media advertising."
    },
    "Idea 10": {
        "Not Optimal MVP": "Public Relations Campaign",
        "Description": "Engaging a PR agency to write and distribute press releases about MyBambooBike to various media outlets.",
        "Feedback": "While PR can be effective, it can also be expensive and time-consuming. A more cost effective strategy could be focusing on building an organic online presence through a website and social media platforms."
