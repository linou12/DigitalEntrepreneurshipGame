"Quality Leadership (High-Price Strategy) and Online Sales
To minimize investments, the bicycles are to be sold online, with the frames ordered from the supplier in Vietnam only when there is sufficient interest. This approach reduces upfront expenses. However, it results in longer delivery times for customers. May and Anna plan to set the price for a bicycle significantly higher than that of comparable bicycles made of metal or carbon.",Idea,"In Task 1, you chose the option 'Quality Leadership (High-Price Strategy) and Online Sales.' That was the right decision! The bamboo bicycle is high-quality and stylish. Additionally, the target audience has a high willingness to pay. By selling online and having Peter and Anna order the frames — a major cost factor — only after sufficient interest is shown, they reduce their risk. This way, they only need to spend money when they know the bicycles will actually be purchased by customers, preventing them from being stuck with unsold inventory.",Optimal
"Quality Leadership (High-Price Strategy) and Local Rental
The bicycles are to be rented at selected locations for a few hours or days. May and Anna plan to set the rental price for a bicycle significantly higher than that of comparable bicycles made of metal or carbon.",Idea,"In Task 1, you chose the option 'Quality Leadership (High-Price Strategy) and Local Rental.' Based on the available data, local rental is not the best strategy. The bamboo bicycle is high-quality, sustainable, and stylish. However, these criteria are not decisive for local rental. Customers looking to rent a bicycle tend to prioritize a low rental price. For these reasons, the option 'Quality Leadership (High-Price Strategy) and Online Sales' would have been the better choice.",Suboptimal
"Cost Leadership and Sales through Retailers
To quickly gain a large market share, the bicycles are to be offered at a price lower than comparable bicycles made of metal or carbon. This follows a classic cost leadership strategy with low margins (the difference between the selling price and the costs) and high sales volumes. May and Anna are relying on sales through retailers, i.e., bicycle shops, which will receive a certain amount for each bicycle sold.",Idea,"In Task 1, you chose the option 'Cost Leadership and Sales through Retailers.' Based on the available data, this is not the best strategy. The bamboo bicycle is high-quality, sustainable, and stylish. Additionally, the target audience has a high willingness to pay. Customers do not need to be convinced by the price. Moreover, it is problematic to pay a commission to the retailer on top of an already low margin due to the cost leadership strategy. For these reasons, the option 'Quality Leadership (High-Price Strategy) and Online Sales' would have been the better choice.",Not Optimal
"Website, Pre-orders, and Social Media Marketing
• To test whether there is sufficient interest in bamboo bicycles and if the online strategy works, May and Anna plan to create a simple website and offer potential customers the option to place binding pre-orders. They intend to promote the website with a small marketing budget on common social media platforms.
• Cost: CHF 500",MVP,"In Task 2, you chose a website, pre-orders, and social media marketing as the MVP. That was a good decision! With a simple website that allows visitors to place binding pre-orders, you can assess whether there is genuine interest in the bamboo bicycle. Unlike surveys asking whether someone would buy something, binding pre-orders show whether people are actually willing to spend money on a product. Additionally, you will already have your first customers if the project is eventually implemented.",Optimal
"Displaying Bicycles in Sustainable Stores
• To test whether there is sufficient interest in bamboo bicycles, May and Anna plan to produce 10 bicycles in Vietnam and display them in stores specializing in sustainability or high-quality bicycles. The bicycles will not yet be for sale. They plan to gauge interest afterward through discussions with store managers and sales staff.
• Cost: CHF 5,000",MVP,"In Task 2, you chose to display the bicycles in sustainable stores. However, this decision has drawbacks. While displaying bicycles in sustainable stores might seem appealing at first, it is almost impossible to gather relevant data on product interest this way, especially if you rely on the statements of store managers and sales staff, who can only perceive customer interest subjectively. The best option would have been to set up a simple website that allows visitors to place binding pre-orders. This would help you assess whether there is real interest in the bamboo bicycle. Unlike surveys asking if someone would buy a product, binding pre-orders show whether people are actually willing to spend money on it. Additionally, this would give you your first customers if the project is ultimately implemented.",Suboptimal
"Street Survey with Pictures
• To test whether there is sufficient interest in bamboo bicycles, May and Anna plan to conduct a street survey using pictures of the bamboo bicycle, asking passersby about their interest in such a product. They also intend to ask for feedback from family and friends.
• Cost: CHF 50",MVP,"In Task 2, you chose a street survey with pictures. This is not the best option. While a street survey with pictures might seem appealing at first, it is almost impossible to capture the true intentions of the target audience. Although the respondents might say they would buy such a bamboo bicycle, you cannot be sure if they would actually do so, or if they were just being polite. In surveys of this type, it is common for respondents to express interest out of courtesy, even when they have no real interest. The best option would have been to set up a simple website that allows visitors to place binding pre-orders. Unlike surveys that ask if someone would buy a product, binding pre-orders show whether people are actually willing to spend money on it. Additionally, this would give you your first customers if the project is ultimately implemented.",Not Optimal
"Option A
• Gender: all
• Age: 27 – 40
• Region: German-speaking Switzerland
• Interests: Sports, Sustainability, Design",Variant,"Feedback for Task 3
You chose the correct MVP variant, as the interview with the persona, a person representing the ideal customer profile, suggested exactly these criteria for a social media campaign. Very well done! In Option 1, 47,000 impressions resulted in 8,745 website visits (18.6% of impressions) and 425 binding pre-orders (4.9% of website visits). This is a much more meaningful result compared to the first social media campaign! Whether May and Anna should continue with MyBambooBike depends not only on the raw facts but also on their expectations.

• Interests: Finance, Nutrition, Sports",Variant,"You chose a suboptimal MVP iteration. Through the interview with the persona, a fictional person representing the ideal customer profile, you could have discovered that there is interest in the topics of sports, sustainability, and design. Option 1 took these criteria into account, but Option 3 did not—although the age matched the persona, the interests did not. As a result, Option 3 led to 35,000 impressions, 2,130 website visits (6.1% of impressions), but only 23 binding pre-orders (1.1% of website visits). Whether Peter and Anna should continue with MyBambooBike depends not only on the raw facts but also on their expectations.",Suboptimal
